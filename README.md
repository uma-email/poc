# PoC
A prototype implementation of the [authorization-enhanced-mail-system][1] draft proposal, working as a proof of concept.

The project comes with:

* poc-apis: A PoC OpenAPI specification.
* poc-databases: PoC database scripts.
* poc-server: A RESTful service that communicates with your email provider.
* poc-client: A client to call REST API against PoC service.

The support for code in this repository is limited, but you are welcome to use it.

note right of client:Client:\n• is registered at the AS as a confidential client and has a client secret
note right of RS:RS:\n• is registered at the AS as a confidential client and has a client secret
client->AS:1. Authorization Grant
AS->AS:2. AS:\n• creates an opaque Access Token using high entropy nonce data string
client<-AS:3. Access Token
client->client:4. Client:\n• generates the Route-JWT with a payload including the Access Token and a timestamp 
note right of client:The Route-JWT is generated as:\nRoute-JWT = header || "." || payload || "." || signature\nwhere\nheader = base64url({"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"})\npayload = base64url({"token":Access Token,"ts":timestamp})\nsignature = base64url(HMAC-SHA256(Key, message))\nwhere\nmessage = header || "." || payload\nKey = SHA256(client's client secret)
client->RS:5. Route-JWT
RS->RS:6. RS:\n• generates the next Route-JWT (aditional claims can be added to the JWT payload)
note right of RS:The Route-JWT is generated as:\nRoute-JWT = header || "." || payload || "." || signature\nwhere\nheader = previous Route-JWT header\npayload = previous Route-JWT payload\nsignature = base64url(HMAC-SHA256(Key2, message2))\nwhere\nmessage2 = header || "." || payload\nKey2 = HMAC-SHA256(Key1, message1)\nwhere\nKey1 = SHA256(RS's client secret)\nmessage1 = base64url decoded previous Route-JWT signature
RS->AS:7. Route-JWT
note right of RS:RS sends the Route-JWT in the Authorization header\nto authenticate itself to the AS introspection endpoint
AS->AS:8. AS:\n a) looks up the Access Token data using the token claim value from the Route-JWT, and checks the token state\n b) generates the Itinerary-JWT in an analogous manner as the Route-JWT using the payload from the Route-JWT\n c) compares the Itinerary-JWT signature with the Route-JWT signature, they are equal,\n     the Access Token route and the Route-JWT have been verified,\n     the AS validates the ts (timestamp) claim value from the Route-JWT, if valid,\n     the AS may return the Access Token introspection response
RS<-AS:9. Access Token introspection response
RS->RS:10. RS:\n• verifies the Access Token introspection response, if true,\n   the RS may return the protected resource
client<-RS:11. Protected Resource

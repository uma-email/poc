opt Alice has to demonstrate control of her email address
note over Alice:If Alice uses an email provider (gmail) that does not support\nthe WebFinger protocol, she must set up her email address to automatically\nforward emails sent from challenge@foo.com to response@foo.com
end
note over claimsProvider:Claims Provider:\n• publishes its metadata on a URL https://foo.com/.well-known/claims-provider-configuration\n• is registered at Alice's IAM Server and is assigned 'query-users', 'view-users' admin roles, thus can query and view any user to get their claims\n• can send email messages from address challenge@foo.com and retrieve from response@foo.com
note over rqpClient:RqP Client:\n• is registered at foo.com IAM Server and pre-registered as a universal AEMS public client at bar.com UMA Server\n• is an agent that can act on behalf of any user registered at foo.com IAM Server
note over rsServer:bar.com Admin has set up the Resource Server and registers it's resource set\n'Incoming' and 'Outgoing' with the bar.com UMA Server with the associated scopes\n'Outgoing': query, view; 'Incoming': create
Alice->rqpClient:Initiate request
rqpClient->rsServer:1. Request Bob's 'Incoming' resource\n(scope=create)
rqpClient<-rsServer:2. 401 with permission ticket
authServer<-rqpClient:3. Get access_token\n(grant_type=client_credentials, scope=claims-provider)
authServer->rqpClient:4. Return access_token "audience":["claims-provider"]
note over rqpClient:• ticket_challenge = Base64URL-Encode(SHA256(ticket))\n• the email_address is specified by RqP Client
claimsProvider<-rqpClient:5. Get claims_token\n(access_token "audience":["claims-provider"], Alice's email_address, ticket_challenge)
authServer<-claimsProvider:6. Get access_token\n(grant_type=client_credentials, scope=realm-management, role=query-users, view-users)
authServer->claimsProvider:7. Return access_token "audience":["realm-management"]

authServer<-claimsProvider:8. Query/View Alice's user_claims\n(access_token "audience":["realm-management"], Alice's email_address)
authServer->claimsProvider:9. Return Alice's user_claims

opt Alice has to demonstrate control of her email address
smtpServer<-claimsProvider:10. Send plain_message from challenge@foo.com to alice@gmail.com\n(claims_provider_configuration_url, ticket_challenge)
imapServer->claimsProvider:11. Retrieve dkim_signed_message sent from alice@gmail.com to response@foo.com\n(claims_provider_configuration_url, ticket_challenge)
end
claimsProvider->rqpClient:12. Return claims_token\n(Alice's user_claims, dkim_signed_message - optional)\nif the payload is large, consider using PCT (see UMA specs. for details)
rqpClient->asServer:13. Call token endpoint\n(ticket, pushed_claims=claims_token)
note over asServer:In addition to claims_token, pushed claims may also contain metadata such as:\n• recipient_info (email address, fullname)\n• file_info (filename, file size, file digest, mime type)
group Authorization process
alt Domain part of email_address or WebFinger is used to locate Claims Provider configuration url
note over asServer:1. extract user_claims from claims_token\n2. select email_address claim\n3. bootstrap discovery of Claims Provider config url from email address via WebFinger;\nif this doesn't work, build well-known url using domain part of email_address\n4. verify claims_token signature \n5. extract ticket_challenge claim from claims_token\n6. compare ticket_challenge vs. Base64URL-Encode(SHA256(ticket))\n7. evaluate user_claims\n8. evaluate other optional claims e.g. recipient_info, file_info
else Alice has to demonstrate control of her email address
note over asServer:1. extract dkim_signed _message from claims_token\n2. verify DKIM signature of dkim_signed _message\n3. extract 'From:' part of dkim_signed_message e.g. Alice Henderson <alice@gmail.com>\n4. extract claims_provider_configuration_url and ticket_challenge from dkim_signed_message\n5. verify claims_token signature\n6. compare ticket_challenge vs. Base64URL-Encode(SHA256(ticket))\n7. extract user_claims from claims_token\n8. evaluate user_claims\n9. evaluate other optional claims e.g. recipient_info, file_info

note over Client:RqP Client:\n• is registered at AS-RqP as a public or confidential client\n• is authorized at AS-RqP by a user and has an access_token_with_user_claims\n• is registered at AS-RO as a public or confidential client
note over RS:RO has set up the RS and registers it's 'RS API' resource at AS-RO
RS<-Client:1. Request to 'RS API' resource
RS->Client:2. 401 with permission ticket
Client->Client:3. Create ticket challenge\n    ticket_challenge = Base64URL-Encode(SHA256(ticket))
AS-RqP<-Client:4. Token exchange request\n    (grant_type=token-exchange, resource="RS API", ticket_challenge,\n      subject_token=access_token_with_user_claims,\n      subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token\n      requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt)
Client<-AS-RqP:5. Return claims_token (user_claims + ticket_challenge)\n    if the payload is large, consider using PCT (see UMA specs. for details)

Client->AS-RO:6. Call token endpoint\n(grant_type=uma-ticket, ticket, pushed_claims=claims_token)
group Authorization assessment
note over AS-RO:1. verify ticket\n2. extract user_claims from claims_token\n3. select email_address claim\n4. bootstrap discovery of AS-RqP config url from email address via WebFinger;\n    if this doesn't work, build well-known url using domain part of email_address\n5. verify claims_token signature\n6. evaluate resource="RS API"\n7. extract ticket_challenge claim from claims_token\n8. compare ticket_challenge vs. Base64URL-Encode(SHA256(ticket))\n9. evaluate user_claims
end
Client<-AS-RO:7. Return requesting party token\n    (RPT)
RS<-Client:8. Get data from 'RS API' resource\n    (RPT)

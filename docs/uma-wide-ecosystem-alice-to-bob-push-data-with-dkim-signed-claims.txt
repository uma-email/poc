Alice->rqpClient:Initiate request
rqpClient->rsServer:1. Request Bob's 'Incoming' resource
rqpClient<-rsServer:2. 401 with permission ticket
alt RqP Client uses Authorization Code Grant - Alice is involved
authServer<-rqpClient:3. a) Get access_token\n(grant_type=authorization_code, scope=claims-provider)
else RqP Client uses Client Credential Grant - Alice is not involved
authServer<-rqpClient:3. b) Get access_token\n(grant_type=client_credentials, scope=claims-provider)
end
authServer->rqpClient:4. Return access_token
note left of rqpClient:ticket_challenge = Base64URL-Encode(SHA256(ticket))
alt Get Claims  - Alice was involved at step  3. a)
note left of rqpClient:Alice's email_address is in access_token returned at step 3. a)
claimsProvider<-rqpClient:5. a) Get claims_token\n(access_token, ticket_challenge)
else Get Claims - Alice was not involved at step  3. b)
note left of rqpClient: The email_address is determined by RqP Client
claimsProvider<-rqpClient:5. b) Get claims_token\n(access_token, Alice's email_address, ticket_challenge)
end
note left of claimsProvider:Claims Provider is assigned the 'query-users' admin role, thus can query any user to get their claims
authServer<-claimsProvider:6. Get access_token\n(grant_type=client_credentials, role=query-users)
authServer->claimsProvider:7. Return access_token

alt Prepare email_address - Alice was involved at step  3. a)
note over claimsProvider:Use Alices's email_address extracted from access_token from a request at step 5. a)
else Prepare email_address - Alice was not involved at step  3. b)
note over claimsProvider:Use Alice's email_address extracted from a request body at step 5. b)
end
authServer<-claimsProvider:8. Query Alice's user_claims\n(access_token, Alice's email_address)
authServer->claimsProvider:9. Return Alice's user_claims

smtpServer<-claimsProvider:10. Send plain_message from challenge@foo.com to alice@gmail.com\n(claims_provider_configuration_url, user_claims, ticket_challenge)
imapServer->claimsProvider:11. Retrieve dkim_signed_message sent from alice@gmail.com to response@foo.com\n(claims_provider_configuration_url, user_claims, ticket_challenge)
claimsProvider->rqpClient:12. Return claims_token\n(Alice's dkim_signed_message)
rqpClient->asServer:13. Call token endpoint\n(ticket, pushed_claims=claims_token + metadata)
note over asServer:In addition to claims_token, pushed claims may also contain metadata such as:\n1. recipient_info (email address, fullname)\n2. file_info (filename, file size, file digest, mime type)
group Authorization process
note over asServer:1. extract dkim_signed _message from claims_token\n2. verify DKIM signature of dkim_signed _message\n3. extract 'From:' part of dkim_signed_message e.g. Alice Henderson <alice@gmail.com>\n4. extract claims_provider_configuration_url, user_claims and ticket_challenge from dkim_signed_message\n5. verify claims_token signature\n6. compare ticket_challenge vs. Base64URL-Encode(SHA256(ticket))\n7. evaluate user_claims\n8. evaluate other optional claims e.g. recipient_info, file_info
end
rqpClient<-asServer:14. Return RPT
rqpClient->rsServer:15. Post data into Bob's 'Incoming' resource\n(RPT)
